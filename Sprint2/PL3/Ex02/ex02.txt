The results may not always be correct due to race conditions that can occur when multiple processes access shared memory concurrently. 
For example, if the parent process increments the first value while the child process also tries to increment it, the final value may 
not reflect both increments. However, in this particular case, since the parent and child processes are both modifying different values 
and there are no dependencies between the operations, the final values should always be correct.
